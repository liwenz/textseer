<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [今天的日期，例如: 2023-10-27]</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how information is handled in the <strong>TextSeer</strong> mobile application (the "App").</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The App processes the following information on your device:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Camera Feed and Images:</strong> When you use the scanning feature, the App accesses your device's camera to capture images in real-time for the purpose of text and barcode recognition.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos from Your Gallery:</strong> If you choose to select an image from your device's photo gallery for recognition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> All image processing is performed <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not store, upload, or transmit any images or the extracted text/data to our servers or any third-party servers.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>The information collected is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To provide the core functionality of the App, which is optical character recognition (OCR) and barcode scanning.</li>
    <li>To display the recognition results to you within the App.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Processing and Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App uses <strong>Google ML Kit</strong> libraries for on-device text and barcode recognition. The images you process are sent to these libraries locally on your device for analysis. Google's use of information is governed by their Privacy Policy, which you can find here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We do not retain any images or recognition results. All processing is transient and happens in memory for the sole purpose of providing you with the result. Once the processing is complete, the image data is discarded from the App's memory.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect or store your personal data, the data subject rights under laws like GDPR do not apply in the context of our App. You maintain full control over the images you process.</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
